== Biography

Soroosh Shafieezadeh Abadeh is currently a postdoctoral researcher at the Automatic Control Laboratory at ETH Zurich, working with Professor [https://control.ee.ethz.ch/people/profile.john-lygeros.html John Lygeros] and Professor [http://people.ee.ethz.ch/~floriand/ Florian Dörfler]. He received his doctoral degree in Management of Technology from Ecole Polytechnique Federale de Lausanne in 2020, where he worked with Professor [https://people.epfl.ch/daniel.kuhn Daniel Kuhn] and Professor [http://www.dcsc.tudelft.nl/~mohajerin/ Peyman Mohajerin Esfahani]. His doctoral dissertation entitled [https://infoscience.epfl.ch/record/277923 Wasserstein Distributionally Robust Learning] was awarded an [https://actu.epfl.ch/news/soroosh-shafieezadeh-abadeh-winner-of-the-thesis-4/ EPFL Thesis Distinction] in 2020. He received a Bachelor and a Master degree in Electrical Engineering (major in Automatic Control) from the University of Tehran in 2011 and 2014, respectively.

His current research interests are focused on optimization under uncertainty, the design of large-scale algorithms for solving stochastic and distributionally robust optimization problems, and the development of statistical tools for data-driven decision-making problems. His research is inspired by applications in machine learning, control, economics and finance.
