I use the [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) static site generator with the [Academic theme](https://github.com/gcushen/hugo-academic) to create my personal website. Hugo is a static site generator, which means unlike dynamic site generators which build a page every time a visitor requests one, it builds all pages when you create your website. The academic theme is generally designed for academic staff and students. You can write in [Markdown](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) for easy formatting and code highlighting, with [LaTeX](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX/Mathematics) for mathematical expressions.
